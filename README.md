Hi! I am currently a Digital Integration Engineer aspiring to become a Solution Architect. I have a profound desire to understand modern technology architectures and am captivated by the integration of technology with other systems. I am driven to design robust and efficient architectural solutions. My background also includes experience as an industrial designer, where I have experience in 3D modeling, rendering, graphic design, and interior design. I miss having the time to work on leetcode challenges tho. ☕

Experience in:
VMware, Ansible, AWS Cloud, Azure Cloud, Google Cloud Platform, API, SNMP, Grafana, CIS benchmark Compliance, KIWI Syslog, Proxmox, Zabbix, network hardwares (Servers, Switches, etc..)
